This repo contains the Unity project as well as a python program for face detection.

To run this project, you need to import the folder `Enhanced-Screen` into Unity as a Unity project. For `full_face_detection.py`, you need python3 with following dependencies(all pip installable):
- opencv-python-headless

dlib library requires cmake, so make sure you have that too.

To run the project, you need to run `full_face_detection.py` first. Then open the scene `Room` in Unity project and hit play. Have fun.
